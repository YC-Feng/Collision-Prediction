# Collision-Prediction
This project aims to predict collision by using machine learning. <br>
There are three algorithms been used: `LSTM`, `XGBoost`, `lightGBM`

### Prediction Method:
Use these algorithms to predict the future location of any moving object. <br>
More than one moving object's future location overlapping can be considered a potential collision. <br>
This project only implemented the future location prediction.
